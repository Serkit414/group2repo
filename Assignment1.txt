Question 1: Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application?

This application will be implemented in a spreadsheet-like style, displaying the forms requested (such as the fuel quote history). We will use a middle layer to communicate 
between the front-end and back-end. A barrier ensuring that only currently registered members can access the site will be implemented. For the front end, including user log-in and form
submission, as well as quota history retrieval, we will use (TBA). For commmunicating with the front end UI and doing computations with user data, we will use (TBA). We will communicate
between the service layer and data with (TBA) and store data in a database with (TBA).

Question 2: Discuss what development methodology you will use and why?

Incremental development has a lot of positive aspects for the scope of this software project. Firstly, different portions of this software will be implemented in separate sections,
and so each of these different submissions can be developed as one increment. One of the negatives regarding the Incremental Model is that it is not good with large complex systems,
but since the requirements are predefined with only five user-defined components, this does not apply. The advantages of this model are very beneficial for this project, as it allows
the different components and functionalities to be available earlier than a linear Waterfall approach. 

Question 3: Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing?
