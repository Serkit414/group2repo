Discussion Notes | Our first meeting was done on February 2 where we discussed the division of work. This included dividing the web app into 6 pages (2 pages per person) and deciding to work individually on the HTML and Javascript, while working together on the CSS to create a uniform web app. This development will be done on Heroku. Our second meeting of this assignment was done on February 9 where we rediscussed our projects platform. We realized that Heroku didn't possess the components we needed and decided to look towards GitHub Pages to host our frontend work. Our third meeting of this assignment was done on February 14 where we breifly discussed the CSS format and our collection of pages. Our forth meeting of this assignment was done on February 16 where we discussed the collection of our seperate material and decided how and when we were going to turn Assignment 2 in. Our final meeting for assignment 2 was done on February 18 where we answered the assignment questions togther and turned in the word document with our work.
